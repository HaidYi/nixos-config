  # The default Nix build user ID range has been adjusted for
  # compatibility with macOS Sequoia 15. Your _nixbld1 user currently has
  # UID 301 rather than the new default of 351.

  # You can automatically migrate the users with the following command:

  #     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://github.com/NixOS/nix/raw/master/scripts/sequoia-nixbld-user-migration.sh | bash -

  # If you have no intention of upgrading to macOS Sequoia 15, or already
  # have a custom UID range that you know is compatible with Sequoia, you
  # can disable this check by setting:

  #   ids.uids.nixbld = 300;

  ids.uids.nixbld = 300;
